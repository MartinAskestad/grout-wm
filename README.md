# grout-wm

A simple tiling window manager for Windows 10 and 11. What sets grout-wm apart from other tiling window managers for Windows is not what is does, but what is does not do. For example other window managers has features like work spaces or tags that help you control what windows are visible on the screen. Grout-wm does not because Windows already does this for you using Virtual Desktops.

To create a new Virtual Desktop, press <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> on your keyboard, you can now navigate between your desktops using <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd> or <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> on your keyboard, or <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, or the little icon next to the Startmenu. And grout-wm will arrange the windows on each desktop for you independantly of other desktops.

Other window managers have configurable hot keys to switch between your open windows. Grout-wm does not because Windows already does this for you. You can use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, or<kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Escape</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Escape</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.

You can set the position of a window by simply draggin it to where you want it.
